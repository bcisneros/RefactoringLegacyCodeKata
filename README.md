# Refactoring Legacy Code Kata

## What is Legacy Code?
It is a code you don't want to touch, but you have to.

## What is Refactor?
Action of changing code structure without changing the current behavior.
in order to improve its quality.

## Steps
1. Identify the code you want to refactor
2. Check if there are Unit Tests that cover this code, if not create them.
3. Validate the test suite is good enough (reliable) to make changes in
production code.
4. Apply small changes to code and run against your Test Suite.

## You need to have:
- Good knowledge about your IDE shortcuts (specially for refactor)
- Good background in Unit Testing frameworks, like JUnit or TestNG
- Use a Control Version System like Git or SVN
